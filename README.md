Welcome to my React project!

To run this repo, Node version 16 is required.

If requirements are met, run npm install & npm start!

I used create-react-app and it's standard setup of actions, components, containers, and reducers.

This project is my portfolio of everything I've done at Flatiron school.
Included are my projects and their corresponding blog posts also the goals I would like to achieve, an introductory page 
about my time at flatiron and a little more information on what led me here.
